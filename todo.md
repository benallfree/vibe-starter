# TODO

- [ ] i'd like `,` to be the hotkey for the debug panel, not f2/f3
- [ ] i'm not sure if it's in there, but i want to be able to change the bull's bucking and spinning probabilities and ranges of severity. a buck makes the hat go up, a spin makes it go to the side. also the quickness of the spin and buck, and in general the bull's movement patterns.
- [ ] it's still too springy, can you you make the spring effect dissapate faster
- [ ]i want to change the falling metrics such that it's something like the ring needs to be green or yellow for 3.5 of the most recent 5 seconds. if it falls below 3.5, you fall. then i'd like a meter that fluctuates up and down, to indicate how close you are to falling. when it fills up, you fall
- [ ] i think it would be cool to see them as a scrolling history off to the side, because then like `points counting` can go in there too and we can eventually add other things like bonuses

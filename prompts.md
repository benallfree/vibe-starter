- [x] 5:30pm i want to make a 3d web game where someone skis down an endless hill. does the term "gnar gnar" refer only to snowboarding?
- [x] 5:32pm make it go slower at first
  - when the game resets after crashing, it suddenly goes faster and the arrow keys no longer work
- [x] 5:40pm when the player hits an obstacle, make him tumble down the hill and get back on his feet. he has 3 lives. after three lives, present a 'game over' screen that goes back to the beginning
  - the lives and the score are overlapping. also, when a life is lost, do an HUD message about it
- [x] 5:55pm make the whole thing snow-covered and make the white blocks into jumps
  - skier.ts:294 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'left') at Object.update (skier.ts:294:15) at animate (skiGame.ts:329:11)
  - it's going super fast again
  - the slanted blocks were supposed to turn into rounded blocks that would launch the skiier into the air and do a flip. make sure if he hits trees he still dies. also, the boulders disappear about halfway up the hill and i just see this little floating snow caps that make me die.
- [x] 6:21pm this is awesome. make him rack up mad bonus points when he jumps, make like a bunch of +10 float around as he jumps or something. and then as it goes faster, make him jump higher and farther. flips should count for +50 and he should be able to do as many as he can before landing.
- [x] 6:26pm the little jumps are sideways, just rotate them 90 degrees
  - [reject] nope, that made the skiier flip sideways. i wanted the jumps to be turned sideways becayse right now the sloped part of the jump is on the sides of the hill instead of up/downhill
  - [reject] nope, that was better, but i meant rotate 90 about yaw, not roll
- [x] 6:33pm periodically let the player pick up a hot chocolate to gain an extra life
  - [reject] whoops, we lost a lot in that one. keyboard stopped working, points stopped working. please try again
  - i don't see any hot chocolate
  - sometimes i pick them up but i don't get credit
  - [reject] actually it seems like it's not going past 5 lives. take that out
  - [reject manual edit] ok this is great, make it less hot chocolate now
- [ ] 6:55pm this may sound strange, but i want all instructions and notifications to be below/behind the skiier at all times. i need to be able to look ahead and see what's going on but the temporary notices block my view. also, please make the instructions only show up on the splash page (please make a splash page) and then on the game over display.
- [ ] the fps is slower on mobile and the whole game goes slower. can you make it so it's the same speed regardless of fps?
- [ ] make big banners that the skiier goes under with advertisements on them
- [ ] pressing the forward arrow makes him french fry and squat down and accelerate
- [ ] pressing the back arrow makes him pizza and slow down
- [ ] moving mouse left/right/up/down does the same as arrows
- [ ] pressing left/right makes snow rooster-tail
- [ ] pressing return should restart the game

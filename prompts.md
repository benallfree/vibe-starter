Each top-level bullet is a fresh chat session. Cursor 0.46.11, Claude Sonnet 3.7

- [x] 5:30pm i want to make a 3d web game where someone skis down an endless hill. does the term "gnar gnar" refer only to snowboarding?
- [x] 5:32pm make it go slower at first
  - when the game resets after crashing, it suddenly goes faster and the arrow keys no longer work
- [x] 5:40pm when the player hits an obstacle, make him tumble down the hill and get back on his feet. he has 3 lives. after three lives, present a 'game over' screen that goes back to the beginning
  - the lives and the score are overlapping. also, when a life is lost, do an HUD message about it
- [x] 5:55pm make the whole thing snow-covered and make the white blocks into jumps
  - skier.ts:294 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'left') at Object.update (skier.ts:294:15) at animate (skiGame.ts:329:11)
  - it's going super fast again
  - the slanted blocks were supposed to turn into rounded blocks that would launch the skiier into the air and do a flip. make sure if he hits trees he still dies. also, the boulders disappear about halfway up the hill and i just see this little floating snow caps that make me die.
- [x] 6:21pm this is awesome. make him rack up mad bonus points when he jumps, make like a bunch of +10 float around as he jumps or something. and then as it goes faster, make him jump higher and farther. flips should count for +50 and he should be able to do as many as he can before landing.
- [x] 6:26pm the little jumps are sideways, just rotate them 90 degrees
  - [reject] nope, that made the skiier flip sideways. i wanted the jumps to be turned sideways becayse right now the sloped part of the jump is on the sides of the hill instead of up/downhill
  - [reject] nope, that was better, but i meant rotate 90 about yaw, not roll
- [x] 6:33pm periodically let the player pick up a hot chocolate to gain an extra life
  - [reject] whoops, we lost a lot in that one. keyboard stopped working, points stopped working. please try again
  - i don't see any hot chocolate
  - sometimes i pick them up but i don't get credit
  - [reject] actually it seems like it's not going past 5 lives. take that out
  - [reject manual edit] ok this is great, make it less hot chocolate now
- [x] 6:55pm this may sound strange, but i want all instructions and notifications to be below/behind the skiier at all times. i need to be able to look ahead and see what's going on but the temporary notices block my view. also, please make the instructions only show up on the splash page (please make a splash page) and then on the game over display.
  - that's good. the splash page is overlapping a different splash page though. please merge them, i want both the server connection status and the other information all in one splash page
  - great, can you display the game playing in demo mode faintly behind the splash? or like the splash is an overlay with some opacity?
  - oops, demo mode made two skiiers appear when the game started. pleaase check carefully
- [x] 7:08pm can you please check to make sure the player gets more points for more hang time? a jump should be +50 points, but each flip while they are airborn should be anouther +50. big jumps should shower them with +50
- [x] 7:09pm the fps is slower on mobile and the whole game goes slower. can you make it so it's the same speed regardless of fps?
  - [reject]
  - no, that didn't work. it's still extremely slow on mobile
- [x] 7:23pm the splash page currently doesn't fit on mobile
- [x] 7:30pm it needs to begin with things moving a little faster. the beginning is too slow
  - he needs to fall over faster, slide fora while, and then get up faster
  - [reject]
  - no, lots of regressions in there. try again. i just want the skiier to fall down faster and stand up faster, please don't get fancy

---

At this point, it seems like it's starting to collapse. there are about 4KLOC. Failure after failure.

---

- [x] ðŸ¤® 7:41pm-8pm make big banners that the skiier goes under with advertisements on them. they appear periodically, not more than 1 every 10 seconds. make a ts file of ads and a folder in static named ads. i'll fill it. for now, ads is just an array of objects and each object has a src attribute. add a little `advertise with us` link in the splash and game over pages.
  - continue without creating images. i already added pockethost.webp, use that one
  - please check the code for errors
  - (pasted vite code message)
  - [revert all]
- [x] ðŸ¤® 9:55pm i want the skiier to pas under big banners as they ski down the hill. they appear periodically, not more than 1 every 10 seconds. make a ts file of banners. public/banners contains the banner images to use. for now, a banner is just an an object with a src attribute. add a little `Buy a Banner` (gnar@benallfree.com) link in the splash and game over pages.
  - skiGame.ts:649 Uncaught TypeError: controls.getDirection is not a function at updateGameState (skiGame.ts:649:16) at animate (skiGame.ts:583:7)
  - skiGame.ts:652 Uncaught TypeError: terrainGenerator.getChunkSize is not a function at updateGameState (skiGame.ts:652:33) at animate (skiGame.ts:583:7). please run a tsc checker to find all of this
  - the poles and banner should start in the distance and then pass by the skiier as he races down the hill. right now, i see the banner fixed in the distance and the poles up front by the skiier
- [x] ðŸ¤® 10:21pm i placed banners in public/banners/\*.webp. I want little obstacle signs posted along the way in the place of trees. little sign posts showing the 800x200 posters. maybe like every 100th tree. also add a little `Buy a Banner` (gnar@benallfree.com) link in the splash and game over pages.
  - [revert all] that's pretty good, but the signs are sideways. can you fix that?
- [x] ðŸ¤® 10:38pm i placed banners in public/banners/\*.webp. please make fencing along both sides of the track and occasionally place banners on those fence segments.
  - that's pretty good, but the fence segments need to run down the side of the slope in parallel and the banners are affixed on them facing inward. the banners are always 800x200
  - that's GREAT. make the banners much bigger. at least 2x
  - excellent. make the banners even 2x bigger and place them high on poles so i can see them coming from a long way away
  - fps went way down. is there a way to precache and reuse the objects? you can make sure there is never a duplicate showing
  - move the fenceline and poles out so they are not on the field
- [x] ðŸ¤® 10:57 make sure there are never more than 2 signs in view at a time
- [x] ðŸ¤® 10:59 make a backboard for each banner (800x200 ratio) that connects to the pole that the banner displays on. the banner goes on the inside (track) side of the backboard
  - sorry, i mean 45 degrees yaw inward from each side
  - that's good, but please: stagger them, make sure they are centered on the pole, and also i can't see the images. are they on the wrong side?
  - i still cannot see the banner images
  - the images are now flipped about the x axis
  - nope, they needed to be rolled 180 degrees. revert and try again
  - now they need to be pitched 180 degrees
  - nope. let's scratch all the image placement code and try again. it's quite simple. the image should be placed rightside-up on the backboard facing the skiier. that's it
  - [revert all] the images are not showing, and no two signs should be near each other
- [x] ðŸ¤® 11:17pm i placed webp images in public/banners. they are all 800x200 (4:1). i'd like to make a new kind of ramp out of them. they will take the place of some of the moguls. can you do that? be sure to optimize them, it was an fps problem before. preloading, object caching, etc.
- [x] 11:24 i placed webp images in public/banners. they are all 800x200 (4:1). i'd like to make a new kind of jump where the skiier can catch air on the banners.
  - the skiier passes right through all the jumps, even the old ones. the banners should be sideways across the hill
  - [reject]
  - try all of this again. it's important to keep it simple and change nothing unnecessarily. i just want you to add another kind of jump that is a wedge using the banner images at random.
  - for some reason the ramps with banners are yawed 90 degrees
  - now the ramps are all facing the correct way but the banners are not again. the banner inside the jump group also needs to be rotated so it matches
  - almost, but now the banner is tilted (rolled) to the left. can you bring up the left side so the top corners of the banner are level?
  - it's very close now. the bottom of the banner needs to be higher than the peak of the ramp
  - we are so very close now. it seems that the banner may be pitched a little, like not exactly vertical on the posts. can you check?
  - it's nearly perfect now. the banner needs to appear in front of the posts though
  - what is the essage displayed on a banner jump? there is an extra message.
  - that's cool, but it only shows `ER`, i assume because it's only wide enough for 2 numeric digits perhaps?
- [x] ðŸ¤® 11:48 please refactor the code for maximum context efficiency
- [x] 11:53 reindex code
- [x] 11:55 please refactor the code for maximum context efficiency by consolidating duplication into helper functions, moving and hoisting functions into separate files when possible, and generally making the code base more scanable and chunkable
  - keep going, this is excellent

- [ ] on mobile, the temporary alerts still block the view and are intrusive.
- [ ] on mobile, there is a touch 'dead zone' that is no good. the skiier should only move during active swiping, not just holding. and it should move instantly but should strafe only at the speed allowed. a swipe and hold in place should not continue moving the skiier.
- [ ] the bonus points for jumps aren't working as expected. it looks like the player only makes 2 flips regardless of how long he is airborn. i want the flips to be a constant speed so he can get more flips for more hang time
- [ ] in demo mode, it shouldn't display any messages it should just ski
- [ ] make "bonus runs" that are just glorious runs of jumps and no obstacles. and even more rarely, make gloriously long runs of just collecting hot chocolate without a worry in the world
- [ ] pressing the forward arrow makes him french fry and squat down and accelerate
- [ ] pressing the back arrow makes him pizza and slow down
- [ ] moving mouse left/right/up/down does the same as arrows
- [ ] pressing left/right makes snow rooster-tail
- [ ] pressing return should restart the game
